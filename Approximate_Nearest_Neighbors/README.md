# Project 4: Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) using Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)

This project implements and analyzes an Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) solution using the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) approach. It includes building the HNSW graph, performing searches, and comparing the results with a brute-force search.

## Topics Covered

*   Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)
*   Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)
*   Vector Search
