# Project 1: Bias-Variance Tradeoff, Regularization, and Learning Rate Policies

This project focuses on the bias-variance tradeoff, regularization, and learning rate policies. It includes derivations, data generation, and model fitting with different polynomial degrees to observe underfitting and overfitting. It also explores the effect of L2 regularization.

## Topics Covered

*   Bias-Variance Decomposition
*   Polynomial Regression
*   Underfitting and Overfitting
*   L2 Regularization
*   Cyclical Learning Rates
