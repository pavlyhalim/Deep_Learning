# Project 3: Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), ONNX Model, and ORT Inferencing

This project is about the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model. It includes downloading a pretrained model, finetuning it on a new dataset, converting it to ONNX format, and deploying it on an ONNX runtime server for inferencing.

## Topics Covered

*   Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)
*   Object Detection
*   ONNX
*   ONNX Runtime Server
*   PASCAL VOC 2007 Dataset
